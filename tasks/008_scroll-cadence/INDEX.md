## AC → step mapping

AC-1 → 1,2,5 · AC-2 → 1,2,5 · AC-3 → 1,2 · AC-4 → 1,2 · AC-5 → 1,2 ·
AC-6 → 3,5 (full AC text in [#23])

## Resume sequence for next session

1. All steps DONE; [PR-24] is open awaiting the **owner's** review+merge
   (PR creation needs the keychain `gh` auth — `shivamsbajpai`; the `.env`
   token `claudeforssb` can file issues but is not a collaborator).
2. [PR-22] (cutover) merges first; GitHub auto-retargets [PR-24] to `master`.
   If [PR-24]'s diff looks polluted with slice-7 commits, rebase onto `master`
   after the cutover merge.
3. Post-merge: write `summary.md`, verify [#23] auto-closed, done. Owner
   feel-check on a real phone is the one open test-plan box.
4. Suites if touching code again: `node --test`, `npx playwright test`
   (a leftover `python3 -m http.server 8099` may already serve the repo —
   [`probe.mjs`](probe.mjs) uses it for live state traces via `window.__optic`).

## Preview deploy (post-plan addition)

[PR-25] (`task/23-v2-preview`, MERGED 2026-06-10) ported the cadence to
master's `/v2.html` staging page for the owner's real-phone feel test —
`scene/` + unit suites byte-identical to this branch, plus v2-side hint
copy/nudge CSS and a `?v=` import bust. Live-verified on
shivambajpai.com/v2.html (~40s after merge). [PR-26] (`task/23-v2-preview-2`,
MERGED 2026-06-10 by the owner) followed up with the 1-tap gate tuning after
the phone feel-test — live-verified (`EDGE_TAPS = 1` served on first poll).
**Gotchas hit:** BOTH preview merges auto-closed [#23] despite refs-only
keywords (reopened each time — the known close-linked-issues footgun), and
when cutover [PR-22] merges, `v2.html` will conflict with this preview
(resolve by taking the redirect).

## Plan defects observed

1. **Nudge animation corrupted the measurement it acknowledged.** The D5
   pulse originally translated the hint *down* 3px. The hint is the last
   child of `.panel-scroll`, and a downward transform on the last child
   extends the scrollable overflow — so `contentMax` breathed ±3px for the
   animation's 380ms, which the gate logic read as real content movement and
   re-armed (`arm` reset on every second tap; the edge never released — found
   live via [`probe.mjs`](probe.mjs), `rs: 185→187→186`). Fix: bob **up**
   (`translateY(-3px)`), which stays inside existing bounds.
2. **The plan assumed `contentMax` is stable; it's a live DOM measurement.**
   Even without the nudge bug, animations/font loads/mobile URL-bar resizes
   jitter it by a few px, letting an edge push "move" 1–2px and re-arm
   forever. Fix in the machine, not the caller: `PIN_SLOP` (4px) on the
   pinned-edge test in `commitStroke`, `MOVE_SLOP` (3px) on the
   cumulative-movement test in main.js, plus a jitter regression unit test.

## Locked decisions (see [`design.md`](design.md))

- D1 stroke quantum: ⅓ gap per stroke; `TRAVEL_LEN` removed
- D2 `settle` arrival freeze + `arm` edge release; settle decrements arm —
  **both tuned 2 → 1 after the owner's /v2 phone feel-test (2026-06-10)**
- D3 stroke detection in main.js (touch end / wheel 250 ms quiet or 800 px
  re-arm / keypress, 48 px commit threshold); state.js stays pure
- D4 boot & fast-travel skip settle; both keep `arm=2`
- D5 absorbed strokes pulse existing hint/lock chrome; copy updated
